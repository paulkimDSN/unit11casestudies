    "Welcome to the Apps project! To give you a taste of your future career, we're going to walk through exactly the kind of notebook that you'd write as a data scientist. In the process, we'll be sure to signpost the general framework for our investigation - the Data Science Pipeline - as well as give reasons for why we're doing what we're doing. We're also going to apply some of the skills and knowledge you've built up in the previous unit when reading Professor Spiegelhalter's *The Art of Statistics* (hereinafter *AoS*). \n",

    "Interesting! Our means of 4.049697 and 4.191757 don't **seem** all that different! Perhaps we've solved our brief already: there's no significant difference between Google Play app reviews and Apple Store app reviews. We have an ***observed difference*** here: which is simply (4.191757 - 4.049697) = 0.14206. This is just the actual difference that we observed between the mean rating for apps from Google Play, and the mean rating for apps from the Apple Store. Let's look at how we're going to use this observed difference to solve our problem using a statistical test. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Outline of our method:**\n",
    "1. We'll assume that platform (i.e, whether the app was Google or Apple) really doesn’t impact on ratings. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Given this assumption, we should actually be able to get a difference in mean rating for Apple apps and mean rating for Google apps that's pretty similar to the one we actually got (0.14206) just by: \n",
    "a. shuffling the ratings column, \n",
    "b. keeping the platform column the same,\n",
    "c. calculating the difference between the mean rating for Apple and the mean rating for Google. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. We can make the shuffle more useful by doing it many times, each time calculating the mean rating for Apple apps and the mean rating for Google apps, and the difference between these means. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. We can then take the mean of all these differences, and this will be called our permutation difference. This permutation difference will be great indicator of what the difference would be if our initial assumption were true and platform really doesn’t impact on ratings. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Now we do a comparison. If the observed difference looks just like the permutation difference, then we stick with the claim that actually, platform doesn’t impact on ratings. If instead, however, the permutation difference differs significantly from the observed difference, we'll conclude: something's going on; the platform does in fact impact on ratings. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6. As for what the definition of *significantly* is, we'll get to that. But there’s a brief summary of what we're going to do. Exciting!\n",
